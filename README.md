# STSD
A large-scale, multi-modal dataset for semantic segmentation of subway tunnel point cloud called subway tunnel segmentation dataset (STSD) is proposed. The STSD comprises point clouds and projected images annotated into 11 categories, encompassing three types of subway tunnels with a combined length exceeding 2700 meters, totaling over 2.26 billion points.
